# Tokens

Tokens are short-lived, limited-scope values intended to be used in situations like a browser session or granting temporary access in service-to-service communication. Software lifecycle events like a user login often result in the issuing of a token only valid for the duration of that session. These tokens cannot be refreshed, meaning once it expires, it's gone forever. Your application is responsible for creating and issuing a new one if the session continues.

A token allows access to **data operations only**. They are unable to perform control plane operations like creating, deleting, or flushing a cache or creating other tokens.

A user with a fully privileged token will be able to perform the following actions:

* Add/edit/delete cache items in any namespace
* Increment counter values via the increment API in any namespace
* Publish and subscribe to any topic in any namespace

It is at the user's discretion to limit the access of a token based on your security requirements.

## The token object

import SchemaView from '@site/src/components/SchemaView';
import tokenSchema from '@site/src/data/schemas/token.json';

<SchemaView title="The token object" schema={tokenSchema} />

## Create a token

Use the `GenerateDisposableToken` function call to create a new token. This token has a max life of 1 hour and cannot be renewed.

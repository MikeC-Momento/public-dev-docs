# Authentication

Both the Momento SDKs and HTTP API use API keys and session tokens to authenticate requests. You can create an API key through the [Momento console](https://console.gomomento.com). Session tokens are created through the Momento Auth client in the SDK. To decide whether your use case requires an API key or a session token, please reference the table below.

<table className="customTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>API key</th>
      <th>Session token</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="highlightRow">What it is</td>
      <td>Key used to identify and authorize the API caller.</td>
      <td>Token that represents a user or system during a short-lived session.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="highlightRow">Creation</td>
      <td>Created one time via the Momento console. Can optionally expire and be refreshed.</td>
      <td>Programmatically generated on authentication or specific system action. Short-lived and not renewable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="highlightRow">Scope</td>
      <td>Can be used to create session tokens, add or remove caches, and all data operations. Able to be scoped to a specific set of permissions.</td>
      <td>Used for data operations only. Can be scoped to specific caches or topics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="highlightRow">Security</td>
      <td>Long-lived with high risk if compromised. Should be rotated regularly.</td>
      <td>Max life of 1 hour. Limited only to data operations like read and write.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="highlightRow">Use cases</td>
      <td>Building integrations, creating a token vending machine, and server-to-server authentication.</td>
      <td>User authentication, browser sessions, and temporary access to data.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
